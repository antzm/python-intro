# Example Jupyter Notebooks using Python Libraries

## Jupyter Notebooks

The easiest way to run Jupyter Notebooks on your computer, is to install the latest version of Anaconda. Choose the version which coresponds to your Operatinng System and install it using the default settings during the instalation.

When you want to run a Jupyter Notebook, you could either start the 'Anaconda Navigator' and select 'Jupyter Notebooks', or for a faster aproach, open the "Anaconda Promt" and type: jupyter notebook

After a few seconds, your default web-browser will open up automatically and a server will be running in the background.

At this point, you could either open an existing Jupyter Notebook or altrenativley you could start from scratch and create a new Jupyter Notebook.
