# Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that are used for training in the AWS SageMaker.  

The notebooks have been created by Udacity for the Machine Learning ND Program and are used here with some modifications, so that the modified code could be imported directly in a SageMaker Notebook.

Otherwise, the usual process is to clone Udacity's repository to a SageMaker Notebook Instance and then, to make all the changes while the Notebook Instance is running.
