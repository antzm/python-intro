# Learning Python


**Facts about Python**
* General purpose language
* Powerful language
* Widely used in industry
* Can be used in a great range of applications

**Examples where Python can is used**  
* Web development
* Data analysis
* Machine learning
* Deep learning

**Important things about Python**  
* Python is case sensitive
* In Python, spacing is important

**Data Types**
* Integers
* Floats
* Booleans
* Strings

**Operators**
* Arithmetic
* Assignment
* Comparison
* Logical

**Whitespaces**
* A block of code is denoted by increasing the identation
* The end of a block of code, is denoted by reducing the identation
* The end of a statement is marked by a newline character
	* For explicit continuation (extending many lines), the character \ can added at the end of each line
	* Multiple line continuation is implied insided (), [], and {}

**Comments**  
* Comments in Python start with a \#
* Multiple line comments:
	* either by using \# in front of each line
	* or by using triple quotes at the beggining and at the end of a comment

**Docstrings**
* Docstring stands for "Documentation String"
* It is used to describe what a certain piece of code does
* Docstrings are included in triple quotes
* It is the first statement in:
	* Functions
	* Classes
	* Modules
	* Methods

**Built-In Functions**
* print(1+2) ## 3

**Arithmetic Operators**

Operator | Operation
-------|-----------
 \+ | Addition
 \- | Subtraction
 \* | Multiplication
 \/ | Division
 \% | Modulo (Mod)
 \*\* | Exponentiation
 \/\/ | Division and rounding down


 **Comparison Operators**

 Operator | Comparison
-------|-----------
x > y | greater than
x < y | less than 
x >= y | greater than or equal to
x <= y | less than or equal to
== | equal to
!= | not equal to  


 **Logical Operators**

 symbol | operation
 -------|----------
 and | logical and
 or | logical or
 not | logical not


**Bitwise Operators**  

symbol | operation
-------|-----------
x & y | bitwise and
x \| y | bitwise or
x ^ y | bitwise exclusive or (XOR)

**Declaring Variables**  

x = 150  
y = 350  
z = x + y  
print(z)  
\#\# 500  

x = 1  
y = 2  
z = 3  
\#\# is equivalent to:  
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3  


**Assignment Operators**

* increase x by 1
	* x = x +1
	* x += 1
* decrease y by 1
	* y = y - 1
	* y -= 1  
* multiple x by 2
	* x = x \* 2
	* x \*= 2
* divide x by 2
	* x = x / 2
	* x /= 2


**Naming Variables**

* Using only lowercase letters
* Using underscores to sepatate words

## Python Lists

### Defining a List  

my_first_list = [5, 8, 7, 15, 3, 10]  

my_second_list = ['five', 'eight', 'seven', 'fifteen', 'three', 'ten']  

my_third_list = [5, 'eight', 7, 'fifteen', 3, 'ten']
